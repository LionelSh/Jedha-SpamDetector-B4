# Jedha-SpamDetector-B4
Is it a SPAM SMS or a Ham?

Three types of nueral networks were constructed to implement the Spam detector,

The classical type in which the SIGMOID layer classifies the <b>vectorized</b> words and their relevance to the SPAM. <br>
The second neural network is an LSTM type , this is useful to build a classfication based on the pattern of phrases. <br>
Final neural network is of the convolutional type meaning used the convolution layer ;) that is usually used for image processing.

Finally , another option based on a ready made model "Bert Model" was fine tunned using HuggingFace. <br>
Why Bert? Because this model is distinguished by its bidirectinal representation of text.

Concepts cover: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Model-Tuning <br>
Technologies used : TensorFlow, keras, Pandas, HuggingFace, NumPy.
